              Deviations are used to represent differences between the intended and actual state of a target.
              They indicate the intended state - or the computed configuration EDA expects, and compare this to the actual or running state, or the configuration retrieved from the target.
              Deviations are most often generated by out-of-band changes to a target by an external system or user, and
              can be accepted or rejected. Rejecting a Deviation will result in the intended configuration being re-applied, undoing the out-of-band change.
              Deviations are raised per table, meaning a single change on a target may result in more than one Deviation.
