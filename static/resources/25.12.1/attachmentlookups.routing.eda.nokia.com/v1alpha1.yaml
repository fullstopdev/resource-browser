          This workflow is used to look up attachments (where an address is attached in the network) on a set of nodes.
          It takes an address, and an optional list of nodes (or node selectors - a list of label expressions) to perform the lookup on,
          and returns the matching attachments, including the node,
          network instance, prefix, interface, and next hop group ID.
        properties:
          address:
            description: |-
              Address to perform a lookup for.
              This is a standard IPv4 or IPv6 address, excluding mask or prefix length, e.g. 12.0.0.1.
            type: string
          networkInstance:
            description: |-
              Network Instance is the locally named network instance to use for the lookup.
              Can be omitted if the default network instance is to be used.
            type: string
          nodeSelectors:
            description: |-
              NodeSelectors is a list of node selectors to execute lookups on.
              This is a list of label expressions, e.g. ["eda.nokia.com/role=leaf", "eda.nokia.com/region=us-west"].
