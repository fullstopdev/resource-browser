              This workflow is used to look up routes on a set of nodes.
              It takes an address, and an optional list of nodes (or node selectors - a list of label expressions) to perform the lookup on,
              and returns the matching route, and the set of egress interfaces that would be used to reach it.
            properties:
              address:
                description: |-
                  Address to perform a lookup for.
                  This is a standard IPv4 or IPv6 address, excluding mask or prefix length, e.g. 12.0.0.1.

                  Network Instance is the locally named network instance to use for the lookup.

                  Node Selectors is a list of node label selectors to execute lookups on.
