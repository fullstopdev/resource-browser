              This workflow is used to look up attachments (where an address is attached in the network) on a set of nodes.
              It takes an address, and an optional list of nodes (or node selectors - a list of label expressions) to perform the lookup on,
              and returns the matching attachments, including the node,
              network instance, prefix, interface, and next hop group ID.
            properties:
              address:
                description: |-
                  Address to perform a lookup for.
                  This is a standard IPv4 or IPv6 address, excluding mask or prefix length, e.g. 12.0.0.1.

              networkInstance:

                  Network Instance is the locally named network instance to use for the lookup.
                  Can be omitted if the default network instance is to be used.

                description: |-
                  NodeSelectors is a list of node selectors to execute lookups on.
                  This is a list of label expressions, e.g. ["eda.nokia.com/role=leaf", "eda.nokia.com/region=us-west"].
