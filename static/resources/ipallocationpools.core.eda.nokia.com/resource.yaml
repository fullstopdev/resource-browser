              IPAllocationPool is a generic IP allocation pool supporting allocation of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses from a set of segments.
              It is different from IPInSubnetAllocationPool in that it returns a single unzoned IP address, i.e. an IP address without a subnet. For example a 10.1.1.0/24 segment could return 10.1.1.1.
              Consult application documentation to know which pool type to use for a given use case.
