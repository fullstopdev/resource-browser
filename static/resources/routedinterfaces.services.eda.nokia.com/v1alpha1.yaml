        description: The RoutedInterface enables the configuration and management of Layer 3 interfaces for routing traffic between different networks. This resource allows for specifying an underlying Interface and Router, configuring VLAN IDs, and setting the IP MTU. It also supports the learning of unsolicited ARPs, defining both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and enabling unnumbered interfaces. Advanced features such as BFD configuration, Proxy ARP/ND, and ARP timeout settings are included to ensure robust and efficient routing.
